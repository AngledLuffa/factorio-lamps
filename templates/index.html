Hi!  If you've come here, you're here for one of two reasons.  Magic:
the Gathering or Factorio.  So let's get right to it.
</p>
<h1>Lantern Control</h1>
<p>
By far my favorite deck to play is
<a href=https://www.mtggoldfish.com/player/AngledLuffa>Lantern Control</a>.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it's gotta a LOT worse in the last few weeks.  At GP
Toronto and GP Tampa it was a great choice.  Just a couple weeks later
at Calgary it was already significantly weaker.
</p><p>
The main issue is that Izzet Phoenix evolved.  They used to be: play
creatures, hope those creatures won.  
<a href=https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442213>Bridge</a>
laughed at that strategy, so the match was almost a bye.  Unfotunately, they now maindeck
<a href=https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397706>Surgical<a>, 
so <a href=https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438642>Thought Scour</a>,
Surgical Bridge is not an unusual thing to
happen.  They also sideboard several incredibly powerful answers such
as <a href=https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430683>Shatterstorm</a>.  
Obviously this is what 
<a https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=438676>Thoughtseize</a> 
and the Lantern lock is for, but the number of cantrips they have,
especially when combined with Pyromancer's Ascension, makes it very
difficult for the Lantern lock to work.
</p><p>
The other problem with the meta is that the decks Lantern preys on the
most are all gone from the meta.  Who wants to play 
<a href=https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=456819>Bogles</a> 
when a flipped 
<a href=https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409836>Thing</a> 
is unstoppable, and who wants to play Ad Naus
when a single Thoughtseize or Spell Pierce stops you for long enough
that you die.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there is hope on the horizon!  Specifically,
Karn, <del>the Great Colorless Hope</del> the Great Creator.  -2 to
get whatever sideboard piece stops your opponent's strategy (options
include Torpor Orb, Witchbane Orb, Damping Sphere... lots of big round
things) or -2 to get Lattice and just end the game.  I don't know if
this will work as I hope, but I haven't been this excited for any card
other than Assassin's Trophy.
</p>
<h1>Factorio</h1>
<p>
My favorite video game ever.  Possibly rivals MtG in terms of how much
I play it.  Have built a couple small factories with friends and one
megabase which has evolved quite a bit over the time I've played it.
</p><p>
I'm working on a script which convert images into blueprints of lamps.  Many many thousands of lamps.  A prototype is <a href=http://angledluffa.com/factorio_lamps>here</a>.
